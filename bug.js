This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and the data source changes frequently, leading to unexpected behavior. It can manifest as blank lists, incorrect rendering, or inconsistent data display.  The root cause is often related to how the `keyExtractor` function is implemented or the way the data source is updated.
