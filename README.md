# React Native FlatList Rendering Errors with Dynamic Data

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with frequently updating data sources. The problem stems from incorrect implementation of the `keyExtractor` function or improper data source updates, causing inconsistent rendering or blank list displays.  The solution provided utilizes a unique key for each item and optimizes data updates.

## Problem Description

When the data source for a `FlatList` changes rapidly, the component might struggle to keep up. If the `keyExtractor` isn't properly configured to generate unique keys for each item, `FlatList` can't effectively identify and update items, leading to incorrect rendering or an empty list.

## Solution

The provided solution focuses on two aspects:

1. **Unique Keys:** Implementing a robust `keyExtractor` function that guarantees unique keys for each data item, even if the data structure changes.
2. **Efficient Data Updates:** Utilizing techniques to minimize the number of re-renders and ensure proper data synchronization between the data source and the `FlatList` component.
